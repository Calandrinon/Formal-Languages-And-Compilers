The symbol table:

Organization:
1. Unsorted tatble - in order of detection in source code    O(n)
2. Sorted table (numeric)                                    O(lg n)
3. Binary search tree (balanced)                             O(lg n)
4. Hash table                                                O(1)

. K = set of keys (symbolic names)
. A = set of positions (|A| = m; m - prime number)

h : K -> A, h(k) = (val(k) mod m) + 1
	. Conflicts: k1 =/= k2, h(k1) = h(k2)

Toy hash function to use at lab: Sum of ASCII codes of chars



Visibility domain (scope)

. each scope - a separate ST
. structure -> inclusion tree 

Example:
int main() {
	int a;
}


void f() {
	float a;
	/// etc...
	int h() {...}
}


void g() {
	char a;
	/// etc...
}

		Hierarchical structure of STs:
		       main
		   /          \
		  /            \
		 /              \
		f                g
		|
		|
		h


                         Formal languages
			 - basic notions -

  A formal language is described by mathematical notations

  Examples of languages:
	. natural: English, Romanian
	. programming (C, C++, Java, Puthon etc.)
	. formal

  A formal language is a set
  Examples:
  L = {a^n b^n | n > 0}, L = {ab, aabb, aaabbb, ...}
  L' = {0 1^n | n>=0}, L' = {0, 01, 011, ...}

  Example:
  a boy has a dog (natural language)

  S -> PV
  P -> a N
  N -> boy or N -> dog
	    (N -> boy | dog)
  V -> QC
  Q -> has
  C -> BN
  B -> a


. A -> a = rule
. S, P, V, N, Q, C, B = nonterminal symbols
. a, boy, dog, has = terminal symbols

Remarks:
1. sentence = word, sequence
2. S => PV => a NV => a NQC => a N has C - sentential form
    In general: w = a1a2a3...an
3. The rule guarantees syntactical correctness but not the semantical correctness (A dog has a boy)



Grammar
. Definition: A grammar is a 4-tuple:
	G = (N, sigma, P, S)
	. N - set of nonterminals a nd |N| < inf
	. sigma - set of terminal symbols and |sigma| < inf
	. P - finite set of productions (rules) 
	. S - start symbol / axiom	

  Remarks:
    1. (alpha, beta) belongs to P - a production denoted alpha->beta
    2. N intersected with sigma = empty set
